# Project Charter - B2B Marketplace Business Model

## Project Overview
**Project Name**: Papain B2B Digital Marketplace Business Model Development Process (BMDP)  
**Business Model**: Digital platform connecting global papain suppliers with buyers  
**Charter Date**: September 8, 2024  
**Project Duration**: 4 months (Phases 0-3)

## Business Context
The global papain market suffers from fragmentation, information asymmetries, and high transaction costs. Buyers struggle to find verified suppliers, while suppliers lack efficient channels to reach global markets. A neutral digital marketplace could address these inefficiencies by providing:

- **Supplier Discovery**: Searchable database of verified papain suppliers
- **Quality Assurance**: Certification badges and verification systems
- **Transaction Security**: Escrow services and payment protection
- **Market Intelligence**: Pricing transparency and market insights
- **Logistics Integration**: Streamlined shipping and documentation

## Strategic Rationale
**Market Opportunity**: The global papain market ($1.2B+) lacks a dedicated B2B marketplace, creating opportunity for platform-based value capture through transaction fees and premium services.

**Competitive Advantage**: 
- Specialized focus on papain vs. generic chemical platforms
- Caribbean-based platform with regional expertise
- Integrated quality verification and logistics services
- Network effects creating barriers to entry

**Portfolio Synergy**: Marketplace model complements other business models by:
- Providing distribution channel for grower/processor businesses
- Creating market intelligence for all papain ventures
- Enabling platform-based scaling beyond direct operations

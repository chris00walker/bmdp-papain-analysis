# Design Brief - Marketplace Business

## Project Context

**Business**: B2B Digital Platform for Papain Trade  
**Phase**: Design (Phase 3 of BMDP)  
**Start Date**: February 1, 2025  
**Design Lead**: Market Analyst  

## Timebox and Schedule

**Duration**: 15 days (February 1-15, 2025)  
**Sprint Structure**: 3 sprints of 5 days each  
**Progress Demos**: February 6 (mid-sprint), February 15 (end-of-sprint)  

## Objectives

1. **Generate Business Model Alternatives**: Create ≥3 viable business model options beyond current validated canvas
2. **Prototype and Test**: Develop detailed prototypes with stakeholder feedback integration
3. **Evidence-Based Selection**: Use weighted scorecard to select optimal business model
4. **Implementation Readiness**: Prepare selected model for Phase 4 validation with roadmap and test cards

## Design Challenge

Based on Phase 2 research insights, design multiple business model alternatives that address the core challenge:

**"How might we create a sustainable, scalable platform that connects Caribbean papain suppliers with international buyers while building trust, ensuring quality, and capturing value for all participants?"**

## Key Constraints from Research

- **Capital Bounds**: $250K-$1M BBD investment range
- **Market Size**: $8-12M Caribbean papain export market
- **Customer Validation**: Food manufacturers (primary), cosmetics (secondary)
- **Supplier Base**: 15-25 Caribbean processors with 200-300MT capacity
- **Revenue Model**: 5-8% transaction fees validated as acceptable

## Success Criteria

1. **Creativity**: ≥3 distinctly different business model approaches
2. **Stakeholder Validation**: Feedback from ≥5 customers, ≥2 experts, ≥2 internal stakeholders
3. **Financial Viability**: Selected model shows path to profitability within 24 months
4. **Implementation Feasibility**: Clear roadmap with defined milestones and resource requirements
5. **Risk Management**: Identified mitigation strategies for top 5 risks

## Deliverables

### Sprint 1 (Days 1-5): Ideation and Prototyping

- **31_ideation.md**: Brainstormed alternatives with inspiration sources
- **32_prototypes/**: Business model canvases for 3+ alternatives
- **Prototype A**: Current validated model (baseline)
- **Prototype B**: Alternative approach #1
- **Prototype C**: Alternative approach #2
- **Prototype D**: Blue ocean/disruptive option (if applicable)

### Sprint 2 (Days 6-10): Feedback and Evaluation

- **33_feedback_log.csv**: Stakeholder feedback collection
- **34_selection_criteria.md**: Weighted evaluation framework
- **35_selection_scorecard.csv**: Quantitative model comparison

### Sprint 3 (Days 11-15): Selection and Planning

- **36_financial_projections.md**: 5-year projections for selected model
- **37_implementation_roadmap.md**: Phased execution plan
- **38_risk_mitigation.md**: Risk assessment and contingency plans
- **39_test_cards.json**: Validation experiments for Phase 4
- **40_integration_decision.md**: Standalone vs integration analysis
- **41_financials_cashflow.csv**: Detailed financial model

## Design Principles

1. **Customer-Centric**: Prioritize validated customer pain points and jobs-to-be-done
2. **Evidence-Based**: Ground all decisions in Phase 2 research findings
3. **Scalable**: Design for growth from MVP to market leadership
4. **Sustainable**: Ensure long-term viability for all ecosystem participants
5. **Differentiated**: Create defensible competitive advantages

## Stakeholder Engagement Plan

### Customer Interviews (Target: 5)

- 2 Food manufacturers (primary segment)
- 2 Cosmetics companies (secondary segment)
- 1 Pharmaceutical company (future segment)

### Expert Consultations (Target: 2)

- 1 Industry consultant/analyst
- 1 B2B marketplace expert

### Internal Stakeholders (Target: 2)

- 1 Technology/platform expert
- 1 Financial/investment advisor

## Communication and Reporting

- **Daily Standups**: Progress updates and blocker resolution
- **Mid-Sprint Demo**: February 6 - prototype review and feedback
- **End-Sprint Demo**: February 15 - final selection and roadmap presentation
- **Stakeholder Updates**: Weekly progress emails to project sponsors

## Resources and Budget

- **Team Allocation**: 4 FTE for 15 days (60 person-days)
- **External Consultations**: $5,000 budget for expert interviews
- **Prototype Development**: Internal resources with potential external design support
- **Research Tools**: Access to industry databases and market intelligence platforms

## Risk Factors

1. **Stakeholder Availability**: Limited access to target customers for feedback
2. **Analysis Paralysis**: Over-engineering selection process vs rapid iteration
3. **Scope Creep**: Expanding beyond core business model design
4. **Resource Constraints**: Team availability during design sprint period

## Success Metrics

- **Completion Rate**: 100% of deliverables completed on time
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: ≥80% of planned interviews completed
- **Model Differentiation**: Clear value proposition differences between alternatives
- **Selection Confidence**: ≥80% team confidence in selected model
- **Implementation Readiness**: Detailed roadmap with defined next steps

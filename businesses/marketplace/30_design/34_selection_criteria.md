### Implementation Feasibility (15%)

**Score 9-10**: Strong team capabilities, adequate resources, low operational complexity
**Score 7-8**: Good team fit, sufficient resources, moderate complexity
**Score 5-6**: Some capability gaps, tight resources, manageable complexity
**Score 3-4**: Significant capability gaps, resource constraints, high complexity
**Score 1-2**: Major capability mismatches, insufficient resources, very high complexity

### Strategic Fit (10%)

**Score 9-10**: Perfect alignment with team expertise, clear strategic coherence
**Score 7-8**: Good alignment, some synergies, coherent strategy
**Score 5-6**: Moderate alignment, limited synergies, acceptable fit
**Score 3-4**: Poor alignment, few synergies, strategic stretch
**Score 1-2**: Misalignment with capabilities, no synergies, strategic mismatch

### Risk Level (10%) - Inverse Scoring

**Score 9-10**: Low market/execution/competitive risks, proven model, stable environment
**Score 7-8**: Moderate risks with clear mitigation, some precedent, stable conditions
**Score 5-6**: Balanced risk/reward, manageable risks, normal market conditions
**Score 3-4**: High risks with uncertain mitigation, limited precedent, volatile conditions
**Score 1-2**: Very high risks, unclear mitigation, unproven model, unstable environment

## Stakeholder Feedback Integration

### Customer Feedback Weighting

- **Primary Customers** (Food Manufacturers): 40% weight in market attractiveness scoring
- **Secondary Customers** (Cosmetics): 30% weight in market attractiveness scoring
- **Suppliers** (Caribbean Processors): 30% weight in implementation feasibility scoring

### Expert Feedback Integration

- **Industry Experts**: Primary input for competitive advantage and market attractiveness
- **Platform Experts**: Primary input for implementation feasibility and risk assessment
- **Financial Advisors**: Primary input for financial viability assessment

## Decision Framework

### Minimum Threshold Scores

- **Overall Weighted Score**: ≥7.0 required for selection
- **Financial Viability**: ≥6.0 minimum (non-negotiable for investor requirements)
- **Implementation Feasibility**: ≥6.0 minimum (execution risk management)
- **No Single Criterion**: <4.0 (avoid fatal flaws in any dimension)

### Tie-Breaking Criteria

1. **Financial Viability**: Higher financial returns preferred
2. **Implementation Feasibility**: Lower execution risk preferred
3. **Stakeholder Feedback**: Higher customer preference scores
4. **Strategic Fit**: Better alignment with team capabilities

### Sensitivity Analysis

- **Weight Adjustments**: Test impact of ±5% weight changes on final ranking
- **Score Ranges**: Use confidence intervals for uncertain scores
- **Scenario Planning**: Best case, base case, worst case scoring for each prototype

## Selection Process

### Step 1: Individual Scoring

Each team member independently scores all prototypes across all criteria

### Step 2: Calibration Session

Team discusses scoring rationale and calibrates scores for consistency

### Step 3: Weighted Calculation

Apply weights to calibrated scores and calculate overall weighted scores

### Step 4: Sensitivity Testing

Test robustness of selection under different weight and score assumptions

### Step 5: Final Selection

Select prototype with highest weighted score meeting minimum thresholds

### Step 6: Documentation

Document selection rationale, key trade-offs, and implementation implications

### Story 2: The Trust Gap in Global Trade

#### Problem

International papain trade suffers from trust deficits between unknown parties. Buyers worry about product quality, delivery reliability, and payment security. Suppliers fear non-payment and contract disputes. Traditional solutions are expensive and slow.

#### Solution

Comprehensive trust infrastructure including supplier verification, product certification, escrow services, and dispute resolution. Digital reputation system builds long-term trust relationships.

#### Who

Risk-averse buyers requiring quality assurance and payment security. New suppliers needing credibility to access international markets.

#### Why Now

Increased regulatory focus on supply chain transparency. Digital identity and verification technologies becoming mainstream. Growing comfort with digital-first business relationships.

#### Mechanics

Multi-layered verification (business registration, quality certifications, reference checks). Smart escrow releasing payments upon delivery confirmation. Blockchain-based reputation tracking across transactions.

### Story 3: The Caribbean Export Opportunity

#### Problem

Caribbean papain suppliers have world-class products but limited market reach. Export processes are complex, relationships are hard to build, and marketing costs are prohibitive for small producers.

#### Solution

Marketplace as export enablement platform, providing market access, trade facilitation, and collective marketing power for Caribbean suppliers.

#### Who

Small-medium papain producers across Caribbean islands seeking to scale beyond local markets. Government trade promotion agencies supporting export development.

#### Why Now

Caribbean governments prioritizing agricultural export diversification. Digital trade platforms reducing traditional export barriers. Growing global demand for natural, sustainably-sourced ingredients.

#### Mechanics

Simplified onboarding for Caribbean suppliers. Integrated export documentation and compliance tools. Collective marketing highlighting Caribbean papain quality and sustainability. Government partnership for trade promotion support.

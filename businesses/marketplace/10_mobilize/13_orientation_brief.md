# Orientation Brief - Business Model Canvas for Marketplace

## Business Model Canvas 101 Primer

### What is a Business Model Canvas?

A visual framework that describes how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value. It consists of 9 key building blocks that cover the four main areas of a business: customers, offer, infrastructure, and financial viability.

### The 9 Building Blocks

#### Customer Side

1. **Customer Segments**: Who are we creating value for? Who are our most important customers?
2. **Value Propositions**: What value do we deliver to the customer? Which problems are we solving?
3. **Channels**: Through which channels do we reach our customer segments?
4. **Customer Relationships**: What type of relationship does each customer segment expect?

#### Infrastructure Side

5. **Key Resources**: What key resources does our value proposition require?
6. **Key Activities**: What key activities does our value proposition require?
7. **Key Partnerships**: Who are our key partners and suppliers?

#### Financial Side

8. **Cost Structure**: What are the most important costs inherent in our business model?
9. **Revenue Streams**: For what value are our customers really willing to pay?

## Business Model Canvas 101

The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management tool that describes how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value. It consists of nine building blocks:

1. **Customer Segments** - Who are we creating value for?
2. **Value Propositions** - What value do we deliver to customers?
3. **Channels** - How do we reach and deliver to customers?
4. **Customer Relationships** - What relationships do we establish?
5. **Revenue Streams** - How do we generate revenue?
6. **Key Resources** - What assets do we need?
7. **Key Activities** - What key activities does our model require?
8. **Key Partnerships** - Who are our key partners and suppliers?
9. **Cost Structure** - What are the most important costs?

## Example Canvas: Barbados Papaya Grower

**Value Proposition:** Reliable, traceable crude papain with consistent potency and quality
**Channels:** Direct export contracts, Regional distributors, B2B platforms
**Revenue Streams:** Crude papain sales ($10-20/kg), By-products (fruit, seeds)
**Key Resources:** Arable land (≥10 ha), Skilled labor, Drying equipment, QA lab
**Key Activities:** Orchard management, Latex tapping, Drying, Quality control
**Key Partnerships:** Export agents, Equipment suppliers, Quality certification bodies
**Cost Structure:** Land preparation, Labor costs, Equipment, Packaging, Quality control

## Storytelling Template: Problem → Solution → Who → Why Now

**Problem:** International buyers struggle to find reliable, traceable sources of crude papain with consistent quality and competitive pricing.

**Solution:** Establish a Barbados-based papaya cultivation and crude papain production operation that provides transparency, local quality control, and consistent supply.

**Who:** International enzyme processors and regional food manufacturers seeking reliable papain suppliers outside of traditional Asian markets.

**Why Now:** Growing demand for natural enzymes, supply chain diversification post-COVID, and Caribbean trade advantages for Western markets.

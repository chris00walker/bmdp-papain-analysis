### 2. Value Propositions (VP) 
What value do we deliver? What problems are we solving?

### 3. Channels (CH)
How do we reach and deliver value to customers?

### 4. Customer Relationships (CR)
What type of relationship do we establish with customers?

### 5. Revenue Streams (RS)
How do we generate revenue from value propositions?

### 6. Key Resources (KR)
What key resources does our value proposition require?

### 7. Key Activities (KA)
What key activities does our value proposition require?

### 8. Key Partnerships (KP)
Who are our key partners and suppliers?

### 9. Cost Structure (CS)

## Example Canvas Reference
**Customer Segments**: International enzyme processors, Regional food processors
**Value Proposition**: Reliable, traceable crude papain with consistent quality
**Channels**: Direct export contracts, Regional distributors
**Revenue Streams**: Crude papain sales ($10-20/kg), By-products

## Storytelling Template: Problem → Solution → Who → Why Now

### Problem
Current papain supply chains lack transparency and consistent quality, creating uncertainty for processors who need reliable enzyme inputs.

### Solution  
Establish traceable papaya cultivation in Barbados producing high-quality crude papain with documented potency and purity.

### Who
International enzyme processors in India, US, EU seeking reliable suppliers. Regional food processors needing local papain sources.

### Why Now
Growing demand for natural enzymes, supply chain resilience focus post-COVID, Barbados agricultural diversification initiatives.

### Mechanics
10-25 ha papaya orchards → latex tapping → controlled drying → quality testing → direct export/regional distribution

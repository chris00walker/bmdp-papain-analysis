# New Business Model Project: Grower (Papaya Cultivation & Crude Papain Production)

## Why This Project?

**Market Opportunity**: Growing global demand for natural enzymes, particularly papain for food processing and industrial applications. Current supply chains lack transparency and consistent quality.

**Strategic Fit**: Aligns with agricultural diversification goals and leverages Barbados' favorable climate, quality reputation, and proximity to key markets in US, EU, and Caribbean.

**Financial Potential**: Target market of $10-20/kg for crude papain with potential for $300K-$1M BBD investment generating 20%+ ROI over 3-year horizon.

## What We're Building?

**Core Business**: Establish 10-25 hectare papaya cultivation operation producing high-quality crude papain (dried latex) for international enzyme processors and regional food manufacturers.

**Value Proposition**: 
- Reliable, traceable supply chain with full quality documentation
- Consistent potency and purity meeting food-grade specifications  
- Competitive pricing with premium for quality and reliability
- Year-round production leveraging Barbados climate advantages

**Target Customers**: International enzyme processors (India, US, EU) and regional food processors seeking reliable papain sources.

## How We're Approaching This?

**Structured Process**: 51-week Business Model Design Process (BMDP) with three phases:
- **Discovery** (26 weeks): Market validation, customer interviews, competitive analysis
- **Validation** (17 weeks): Prototype testing, pilot operations, financial modeling  
- **Scaling** (8 weeks): Business case finalization, implementation planning

**Rigorous Validation**: Customer interviews, letters of intent, agricultural feasibility studies, and financial modeling before major capital commitment.

**Milestone-Based Investment**: Progressive capital unlocking ($300K → $500K → $750K → $1M BBD) based on validated milestones and proven market demand.

## Timeline & Next Steps

**Phase 1 (Current)**: Team mobilization, stakeholder alignment, initial market research
**Phase 2**: Customer validation, operational feasibility, pilot testing
**Phase 3**: Business case completion, investment decision, implementation planning

**Key Decision Points**: 
- Week 26: Discovery complete - proceed to validation?
- Week 43: Validation complete - proceed to scaling?  
- Week 51: Final go/no-go investment decision

## Team & Resources

**Core Team**: 4-person cross-functional team (Strategy Lead, Business Expert, Market Analyst, Financial Analyst)
**Budget**: $45,000 BBD for complete BMDP process (15% of initial capital)
**Governance**: Weekly team standups, biweekly sponsor reviews, milestone-based approvals

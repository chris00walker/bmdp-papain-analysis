# Idea Stories

## Story 1: The Reliable Caribbean Source

**Problem:** International enzyme processors face supply chain risks from concentrated Asian production, quality inconsistencies, and long lead times that impact their manufacturing schedules.

**Solution:** Establish a Barbados-based papaya cultivation operation that provides reliable, traceable crude papain with consistent quality, shorter supply chains to Western markets, and transparent production practices.

**Who:** Mid-to-large enzyme processors in the US, EU, and India who prioritize supply chain security and are willing to pay a premium for reliability and traceability.

**Why Now:** Post-COVID supply chain disruptions have highlighted the risks of over-dependence on single regions. Growing regulatory requirements for traceability and quality documentation create opportunities for transparent, well-documented suppliers.

**Mechanics:**

- 10-25 hectare papaya orchard with systematic latex tapping
- On-site drying and quality control facilities
- Direct relationships with 5-10 key buyers through long-term contracts
- Premium positioning at $15-18/kg vs. commodity pricing at $10-12/kg

## Story 2: The Cooperative Advantage

**Problem:** Individual small farmers in Barbados lack the scale, resources, and market access to compete effectively in the global papain market, leading to missed economic opportunities.

**Solution:** Form a papain growers' cooperative that pools resources, shares knowledge, achieves economies of scale, and provides collective bargaining power for better pricing and market access.

**Who:** Small-scale farmers in Barbados seeking diversification opportunities, government agencies promoting agricultural development, and buyers seeking stable, community-based supply chains.

**Why Now:** Growing emphasis on sustainable and socially responsible sourcing creates market opportunities for cooperative models. Government support for agricultural diversification provides funding and policy backing.

**Mechanics:**

- 15-20 member cooperative with shared processing facilities
- Collective quality standards and certification programs
- Shared marketing and sales through cooperative board
- Member profit-sharing based on quality and volume contributions

## Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Individual Scoring
Each team member scores each prototype on all criteria independently

### Step 2: Discussion and Calibration
Team discusses scoring rationale and calibrates understanding of criteria

### Step 3: Consensus Scoring
Team reaches consensus on final scores for each prototype

### Step 4: Weighted Calculation
Calculate weighted scores using the defined percentages

### Step 5: Sensitivity Analysis
Test impact of different weighting scenarios on final rankings

## Decision Framework

### Minimum Thresholds
- Overall weighted score must be ≥7.0 to proceed
- No single criterion can score below 5.0
- Financial viability must score ≥7.0 given investment requirements

### Tie-Breaking Criteria
1. Financial viability score (highest wins)
2. Implementation feasibility score (highest wins)
3. Team consensus preference

### Risk Assessment
- Scores below 6.0 on risk level require detailed mitigation plan
- High-risk/high-reward options need explicit risk acceptance

## Validation Requirements

### Market Validation
- Customer interviews confirming willingness to pay
- Competitive analysis supporting differentiation claims
- Market sizing validation through multiple sources

### Financial Validation
- Detailed financial model with sensitivity analysis
- Customer acquisition cost and lifetime value analysis
- Break-even analysis with multiple scenarios

### Operational Validation
- Resource requirement assessment
- Timeline feasibility with key milestones
- Risk mitigation strategies for top concerns

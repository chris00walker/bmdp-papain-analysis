**Facilitator**: Business Expert  
**Participants**: Business Expert, Market Analyst, Financial Analyst  
**Duration**: 4 hours  
**Method**: Divergent thinking + Blue Ocean Strategy + Constraint challenges  

## Design Challenge

**How might we create a differentiated papain business model that captures premium value while addressing the contradictions identified in Phase 2 research?**

## Key Contradictions to Address

1. **Quality vs. Scale**: Premium quality demands vs. minimum viable production scale
2. **Organic vs. Pharmaceutical**: Dual market requirements with different standards
3. **Geographic Advantage vs. Cost**: Local benefits vs. production cost competitiveness

## Ideation Sources

### Phase 2 Insights

- Premium pricing potential (15-30% above commodity)
- Quality consistency as primary differentiator
- Geographic advantage for supply chain reliability
- Sustainability/traceability emerging market trend
- Multi-year contracts feasible with quality assurance

### Competitor Pattern Analysis

- **Vertical Integration**: Most competitors focus on single stage (growing OR processing)
- **Geographic Concentration**: Heavy Asia focus creates supply chain vulnerability
- **Commodity Positioning**: Most compete on price rather than quality/service
- **Limited Innovation**: Traditional processing methods, minimal R&D investment

### Blue Ocean Inspirations

- **Specialty Coffee Model**: Premium positioning through origin story and quality
- **Pharmaceutical Contract Manufacturing**: Service-based revenue with guaranteed volumes
- **Subscription Agriculture**: Predictable revenue through membership models
- **Platform Business**: Connecting multiple growers with multiple buyers

## Constraint Challenges

### 10x Budget Challenge ($7.5M instead of $750K)

**What would we do differently?**

- Acquire multiple farms across Caribbean for supply diversification
- Build state-of-the-art processing facility with pharmaceutical-grade certification
- Develop proprietary extraction technology for higher yields
- Create vertically integrated supply chain from farm to finished product
- Establish R&D lab for enzyme optimization and new applications

### 1/10x Budget Challenge ($75K instead of $750K)

**What would we do differently?**

- Partner with existing papaya farmers instead of owning land
- Use toll processing instead of building own facility
- Focus on brokerage/trading model connecting growers to buyers
- Leverage digital platform for quality verification and logistics
- Start with single high-value customer relationship

### Geographic Constraint Challenge

**What if we couldn't operate in Barbados?**

- License production model to farmers in optimal growing regions
- Create quality certification program for distributed growers
- Focus on supply chain orchestration and quality assurance
- Develop mobile processing units for on-site extraction

## Project Context

**Business**: Papain enzyme production from papaya cultivation in Barbados  
**Phase**: Design (Phase 3 of BMDP)  
**Date**: 2025-01-09  
**Team Lead**: Business Expert  

## Design Sprint Overview

### Timebox

- **Duration**: 15 days
- **Start Date**: 2025-01-09
- **End Date**: 2025-01-24
- **Budget Allocation**: $127,500 BBD (17% of $750K post-validation capital)

### Objectives

1. **Generate ≥3 viable business model alternatives** beyond status quo
2. **Select optimal business model** through evidence-based evaluation
3. **Create detailed implementation roadmap** for chosen model
4. **Validate key assumptions** through rapid prototyping and stakeholder feedback

### Key Deliverables

- [ ] Ideation session results with ≥3 bold alternatives
- [ ] Business model canvas prototypes for each alternative
- [ ] Stakeholder feedback from ≥5 customers, ≥2 experts, ≥2 internal
- [ ] Selection scorecard with weighted criteria evaluation
- [ ] Financial projections for selected prototype
- [ ] Implementation roadmap with phases and milestones
- [ ] Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- [ ] Test cards for assumption validation
- [ ] Integration/separation decision analysis
- [ ] Final recommendation with business case

### Success Criteria

- **Quality**: Each prototype addresses different market segments/value propositions
- **Feasibility**: Selected model aligns with resource constraints and capabilities

# Research Bias Check - Processor (Pharma-Grade Papain Refining, Barbados)

## Bias Assessment Overview

This analysis examines potential biases in our research methodology and findings to ensure objective decision-making for the Processor (Pharma-Grade Papain Refining, Barbados) business model design process.

## Research Methodology Bias Analysis

### Selection Bias Assessment

**Participant Selection Process**: Industry conference contacts, pharmaceutical trade associations, LinkedIn pharmaceutical groups

**Potential Biases Identified**:
- **Network Bias**: Over-representation of North American pharmaceutical contacts
- **Geographic Bias**: Limited Caribbean and Latin American pharmaceutical perspectives
- **Industry Bias**: Skew toward large pharmaceutical companies vs. specialty manufacturers
- **Size Bias**: Under-representation of small biotech companies

**Bias Mitigation Actions Taken**:
- Targeted outreach to Caribbean pharmaceutical distributors
- Contacted specialty enzyme manufacturers globally
- Used industry association directories for balanced sampling

**Remaining Bias Risk**: Medium - geographic bias toward developed markets remains

### Confirmation Bias Assessment

**Research Question Framing**: Open-ended questions about enzyme sourcing challenges and quality requirements

**Potential Biases Identified**:
- **Leading Questions**: Some questions implied pharmaceutical-grade was superior to food-grade
- **Interviewer Bias**: Team enthusiasm for pharma-grade processing may have influenced probing
- **Interpretation Bias**: Strong preference for findings supporting high-margin pharma focus

**Bias Mitigation Actions Taken**:
- Used structured interview guide with neutral enzyme quality questions
- Independent analysis by team members with different perspectives
- Specifically asked about successful food-grade enzyme suppliers

**Remaining Bias Risk**: Medium - team bias toward pharma-grade opportunity

### Response Bias Assessment

**Interview Environment**: Professional, recorded with consent

**Potential Biases Identified**:
- **Social Desirability**: Participants may have given 'expected' answers
- **Acquiescence Bias**: Tendency to agree with interviewer statements
- **Recall Bias**: Inaccurate recollection of past experiences

**Bias Mitigation Actions Taken**:
- Asked for specific examples and evidence
- Used behavioral questions about actual experiences
- Cross-validated responses across multiple participants

**Remaining Bias Risk**: Medium - inherent in interview methodology

## Data Analysis Bias Assessment

### Cherry-Picking Bias

**Risk Assessment**: Medium - natural tendency to highlight supportive findings

**Controls Implemented**:
- Documented all findings, including negative results
- Used quantitative metrics where possible
- Independent review of conclusions by team members

### Anchoring Bias

**Initial Assumptions**: Strong beliefs about market opportunity and solution fit

**Risk Assessment**: High - team has invested significant effort in concept

**Controls Implemented**:
- Explicitly tested core assumptions with specific success criteria
- Sought external expert opinions to challenge assumptions
- Used structured assumption testing framework

### Survivorship Bias

**Data Completeness**: Included both successful and failed implementations in research

**Risk Assessment**: Low - actively sought diverse perspectives

**Controls Implemented**:
- Interviewed customers who had negative experiences with competitors

- External expert review of assumptions

### Availability Heuristic

**Recent Information Influence**: Latest interviews may disproportionately influence conclusions

**Bias Risk**: Medium - natural tendency to weight recent information

**Controls Implemented**:
- Systematic review of all data, not just recent findings
- Quantitative analysis to balance qualitative impressions
- Timeline analysis to identify pattern changes

### Sunk Cost Fallacy

**Investment to Date**: Significant time and resources invested in current direction

**Bias Risk**: High - strong motivation to justify continued investment

**Controls Implemented**:
- Explicit go/no-go criteria independent of past investment
- Focus on future potential rather than past effort
- Regular reassessment of strategic direction

# Regulatory Pathway Analysis - Processor Business Model

## Executive Summary

**Regulatory Classification**: Papain for pharmaceutical use falls under FDA Drug Master File (DMF) requirements and EMA Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) regulations. Caribbean-based facility would require FDA registration as Foreign Drug Manufacturing Establishment and EMA Written Confirmation for API manufacturing.

**Timeline Estimate**: 18-24 months for full regulatory compliance including facility certification, process validation, and market authorization.

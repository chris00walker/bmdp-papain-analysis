# Project Charter - Processor Business Model

## Project Overview

### Business Concept

**Pharma-Grade Papain Refining Operation** - Establish a GMP-compliant processing facility in Barbados to produce pharmaceutical-grade papain enzyme (≥6,000 USP U/mg) for global pharmaceutical and cosmetic markets.

### Strategic Context

- **Market Position**: Caribbean-based alternative to Asian suppliers with Western regulatory compliance
- **Value Proposition**: High-purity papain with geographic proximity to US/EU markets
- **Target Customers**: Pharmaceutical distributors (Merck, Mitsubishi, Sigma), wound care companies, nutraceuticals, cosmetics

## Project Scope

### In Scope

- GMP-compliant processing facility design and setup
- Purification technology (ultrafiltration, chromatography, lyophilization)
- Quality assurance and regulatory compliance systems
- Supply chain for raw papaya latex (25+ ha equivalent)
- Market entry strategy for pharma-grade customers
- Financial modeling and investment requirements

### Out of Scope

- Raw papaya cultivation (sourced from suppliers)
- Consumer-grade papain products
- Non-pharmaceutical applications
- International facility locations outside Barbados

## Success Criteria

### Financial Targets

- **Revenue**: $60-90/kg pricing for pharma-grade papain
- **Production Capacity**: Process output from 25+ ha orchards
- **ROI**: Target 25%+ return on $1.5-2M investment
- **Payback Period**: ≤5 years given high CAPEX

### Market Validation

- Secure 3+ Letters of Intent from pharmaceutical distributors
- Validate pricing acceptance at $60-90/kg premium
- Confirm regulatory pathway feasibility (FDA, EMA)
- Establish supply agreements for raw latex

### Operational Excellence

- Achieve GMP certification within 18 months
- Maintain ≥6,000 USP U/mg activity levels
- Establish quality systems (HACCP, CoA)
- Build skilled technical team

## Key Stakeholders

### Primary Stakeholders

## Resource Requirements

### Capital Investment

- **Facility**: $1.5-2M for GMP-compliant processing plant
- **Equipment**: Ultrafiltration, chromatography, lyophilization systems
- **Working Capital**: 6-month operating expense buffer
- **Regulatory**: Certification and audit costs

### Human Resources

- **Technical Team**: 8-12 FTE (process engineers, QA specialists, technicians)
- **Management**: Operations manager, quality manager
- **Consulting**: Regulatory, technical, market development expertise

### Timeline

- **Phase 0-3 Analysis**: 6 months
- **Facility Development**: 12-18 months

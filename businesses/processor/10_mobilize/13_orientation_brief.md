## Business Model Canvas 101 Primer

The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management tool that describes how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value. It consists of 9 key building blocks:

1. **Customer Segments** - Who are we creating value for?
2. **Value Propositions** - What value do we deliver to customers?
3. **Channels** - How do we reach and deliver to customers?
4. **Customer Relationships** - What relationships do we establish?
5. **Revenue Streams** - How do we generate revenue?
6. **Key Resources** - What key resources does our value proposition require?
7. **Key Activities** - What key activities does our value proposition require?
8. **Key Partnerships** - Who are our key partners and suppliers?
9. **Cost Structure** - What are the most important costs in our business model?

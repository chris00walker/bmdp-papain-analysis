# Idea Stories - Processor Business

## Core Business Story

**Problem:** Pharmaceutical and cosmetics companies currently rely heavily on Asian papain suppliers, facing challenges with quality consistency, long supply chains, regulatory compliance gaps, and supply chain risks exposed during recent global disruptions.

**Solution:** Establish a GMP-certified papain processing facility in Barbados that produces pharmaceutical-grade papain (â‰¥6,000 USP U/mg) with full Western regulatory compliance, offering a Caribbean-based alternative that reduces supply chain distance and risk for North American and European customers.

**Who:** 
- Primary customers: Large pharmaceutical ingredient distributors (Merck, Mitsubishi, Sigma-Aldrich) who need reliable, compliant suppliers
- Secondary customers: Wound care manufacturers requiring sterile papain for medical applications
- Tertiary customers: Nutraceutical and cosmetics companies seeking high-purity enzyme ingredients

**Why Now:** 
- Increased focus on supply chain diversification post-COVID
- Growing demand for Western-regulated alternatives to Asian suppliers
- Rising quality standards in pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries
- Caribbean trade advantages and proximity to major Western markets
- Local papaya cultivation expertise and favorable growing conditions

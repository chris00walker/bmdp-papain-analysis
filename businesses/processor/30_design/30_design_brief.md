## Design Challenge

**Core Question**: How do we optimize the business model architecture to maximize value capture while minimizing execution risk?

**Key Trade-offs to Resolve**:
1. **Market Focus**: Broad pharmaceutical market vs specialized wound care niche
2. **Value Proposition**: Product excellence vs technical partnership vs supply chain security
3. **Geographic Strategy**: Global market vs regional Caribbean/Latin American focus
4. **Revenue Model**: Premium product pricing vs service-enhanced pricing vs hybrid approach
5. **Implementation Speed**: Aggressive market entry vs phased capability building

## Design Constraints

### Must-Have Requirements
- **Regulatory Compliance**: GMP certification and FDA/EMA approval mandatory
- **Quality Standards**: Pharmaceutical-grade consistency (≥6,000 USP U/mg, ±10% variation)
- **Financial Returns**: Minimum 20% ROI to justify investment risk

### Boundary Conditions
- **Investment Limit**: Maximum $3.5M total investment (facility + working capital + regulatory)
- **Timeline Constraint**: Market entry within 30 months from project start
- **Geographic Scope**: Caribbean-based facility with Western market focus
- **Regulatory Jurisdiction**: FDA and EMA compliance required for target markets

### Risk Tolerance
- **Regulatory Risk**: Medium - acceptable given defensible competitive advantage
- **Market Risk**: Low-Medium - strong customer validation reduces uncertainty
- **Technical Risk**: Low - established technology with proven commercial applications
- **Financial Risk**: Medium - attractive returns justify investment requirements

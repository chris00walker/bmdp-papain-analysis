# Design Brief - Processor Business

## Design Timebox
- **Duration**: 15 days
- **Start Date**: Week 7 of Discovery Phase
- **End Date**: Week 9 of Discovery Phase

## Design Objectives
1. **Generate ≥3 viable business model alternatives** beyond the baseline pharmaceutical processing model
2. **Select optimal business model** through evidence-based evaluation and stakeholder feedback
3. **Create detailed implementation roadmap** for the selected model
4. **Validate key assumptions** through rapid prototyping and stakeholder engagement
5. **Establish financial projections** and investment requirements for the chosen approach

## Key Design Questions
- Should we focus on pharmaceutical-only or multi-segment approach?
- What is the optimal facility scale and processing capabilities?
- How do we balance premium positioning vs. volume requirements?
- What partnerships and integration opportunities should we pursue?
- How do we sequence market entry and capability development?

# Orientation Brief - Business Model Canvas 101

## Business Model Canvas Primer

The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management tool that describes how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value. It consists of 9 key building blocks:

### The 9 Building Blocks

1. **Customer Segments** - Who are we creating value for?
2. **Value Propositions** - What value do we deliver to customers?
3. **Channels** - How do we reach and deliver to customers?
4. **Customer Relationships** - What relationships do we establish?
5. **Revenue Streams** - How do we generate revenue?
6. **Key Resources** - What key resources does our value proposition require?
7. **Key Activities** - What key activities does our value proposition require?
8. **Key Partnerships** - Who are our key partners and suppliers?
9. **Cost Structure** - What are the most important costs in our business model?

## Example Canvas: Regional Food Distributor

**Customer Segments**: Regional restaurants, food manufacturers, retail chains
**Value Propositions**: Reliable supply, quality assurance, competitive pricing, local expertise
**Channels**: Direct sales, online ordering, distributor partnerships
**Customer Relationships**: Personal service, account management, technical support
**Revenue Streams**: Product markup (20-30%), logistics fees, value-added services
**Key Resources**: Warehouse facilities, cold storage, delivery fleet, supplier relationships
**Key Activities**: Sourcing, inventory management, quality control, logistics, sales
**Key Partnerships**: Food producers, logistics providers, quality labs
**Cost Structure**: Inventory costs, facility operations, transportation, staff

## Storytelling Template

Use this framework to tell your business story:

**Problem** → What customer pain point are we solving?
**Solution** → How does our business model address this pain?
**Who** → Which specific customer segments benefit most?
**Why Now** → What market conditions make this the right time?
**Mechanics** → How do we create, deliver, and capture value?

## Canvas Development Process

1. **Draft v0** - Initial hypothesis based on business brief
2. **Research & Validate** - Test assumptions with customers and market data
3. **Iterate** - Refine based on learning and feedback
4. **Finalize** - Lock in validated business model for implementation

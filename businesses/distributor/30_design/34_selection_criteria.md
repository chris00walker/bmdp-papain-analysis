# Selection Criteria - Distributor Business

## Selection Framework

### Criteria Weighting Based on Phase 2 Insights
The weighting reflects the critical success factors identified through customer research and market analysis:

1. **Market Attractiveness (25%)** - Addresses customer pain points and market size
2. **Competitive Advantage (20%)** - Sustainable differentiation and barriers to entry
3. **Financial Viability (20%)** - ROI, capital efficiency, and revenue potential
4. **Implementation Feasibility (15%)** - Execution complexity and resource requirements
5. **Strategic Fit (10%)** - Alignment with organizational capabilities and goals
6. **Risk Level (10%)** - Business model risks and mitigation requirements

## Detailed Criteria Definitions

### Market Attractiveness (25% weight)

- Technology development and integration needs
- Supplier and partner relationship complexity
- Regulatory compliance and approval requirements

**Scoring Scale (1-10)**:
- 9-10: Low complexity, existing capabilities, minimal technology needs
- 7-8: Moderate complexity, some new capabilities, standard technology
- 5-6: High complexity, significant new capabilities, custom technology
- 1-4: Very high complexity, major capability gaps, complex technology

### Strategic Fit (10% weight)
**Definition**: Alignment with organizational capabilities and strategic goals

**Evaluation Factors**:
- Leverage of existing capabilities and relationships
- Alignment with long-term strategic vision
- Synergies with potential future business expansion
- Cultural fit and organizational readiness
- Learning and capability development opportunities

**Scoring Scale (1-10)**:
- 9-10: Perfect alignment, leverages strengths, clear synergies
- 7-8: Good alignment, some leverage, moderate synergies
- 5-6: Partial alignment, limited leverage, few synergies
- 1-4: Poor alignment, no leverage, conflicting priorities

### Risk Level (10% weight)
**Definition**: Business model risks and mitigation requirements (inverse scoring)

**Evaluation Factors**:
- Market risk and demand uncertainty
- Competitive response and disruption risk
- Operational and execution risks
- Financial and cash flow risks
- Regulatory and compliance risks

**Scoring Scale (1-10, higher score = lower risk)**:
- 9-10: Low risk, proven model, strong mitigation strategies
- 7-8: Moderate risk, manageable uncertainties, good mitigation
- 5-6: High risk, significant uncertainties, limited mitigation
- 1-4: Very high risk, major uncertainties, weak mitigation

## Evaluation Process

### Scoring Methodology
1. **Individual Assessment**: Each prototype scored independently on each criterion
2. **Evidence-Based Scoring**: Scores supported by Phase 2 research data and stakeholder feedback
3. **Team Consensus**: Core team discussion and alignment on scores
4. **Weighted Calculation**: Final scores calculated using weighted criteria
5. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Test impact of different weighting scenarios

### Decision Threshold
- **Minimum Viable Score**: 6.5/10 weighted average for consideration
- **Clear Winner Margin**: ≥0.5 point difference for confident selection
- **Tie-Breaking Criteria**: Financial viability and market attractiveness prioritized

### Validation Requirements
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Selected prototype must have positive stakeholder feedback
- **Financial Validation**: Must meet ROI targets and capital constraints
- **Implementation Readiness**: Clear path to execution with available resources
- **Risk Acceptability**: Risk profile acceptable to investment committee

## Selection Decision Framework

### Go/No-Go Criteria
**GO Decision Requirements**:
- Weighted score ≥7.0/10
- Positive stakeholder feedback from ≥70% of interviews
- Financial projections meet minimum ROI targets (15%+ IRR)
- Capital requirements within bounds ($800K BBD maximum)
- Clear implementation roadmap with defined milestones

**NO-GO Decision Triggers**:
- Weighted score <6.5/10
- Negative stakeholder feedback from >40% of interviews
- Financial projections below minimum thresholds
- Capital requirements exceed bounds
- Implementation risks deemed unacceptable

### Contingency Planning

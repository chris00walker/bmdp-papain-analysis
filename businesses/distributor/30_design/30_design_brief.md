- **Product Focus**: Papain enzyme distribution (food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical grades)
- **Regulatory Environment**: Caribbean compliance requirements

### Operational Constraints
- **Location**: Barbados as regional hub (established in Phase 2)
- **Quality Requirements**: Local testing and certification capabilities
- **Supply Chain**: Multi-source supplier strategy for reliability

## Design Team Allocation

### Core Team (100% allocation during design phase)
- **Project Leader**: Overall design coordination and decision-making
- **Business Analyst**: Market analysis, financial modeling, competitive intelligence
- **Operations Manager**: Operational design, supply chain, quality systems
- **Business Development Lead**: Customer insights, value proposition design

- **Legal Counsel**: Regulatory compliance and risk assessment

## Progress Demonstrations

### Mid-Sprint Demo (Day 7)
**Deliverables**: Ideation results, prototype canvases, initial stakeholder feedback
**Audience**: Project sponsor, key stakeholders
**Success Metrics**: ≥3 viable prototypes, positive stakeholder engagement

### End-of-Sprint Demo (Day 15)
**Deliverables**: Complete selection framework, chosen prototype, implementation roadmap
**Audience**: Investment committee, project sponsor
**Success Metrics**: Clear prototype selection, financial validation, implementation readiness

## Design Methodology

### Creative Ideation Approach
- **Blue Ocean Thinking**: Challenge industry assumptions and explore new value spaces
- **Constraint Relaxation**: "What if budget was 10x? 1/10x?" scenarios
- **Customer-Centric Design**: Jobs-to-be-Done insights drive value proposition design
- **Competitive Differentiation**: Leverage Phase 2 competitive gaps and opportunities

### Validation Framework

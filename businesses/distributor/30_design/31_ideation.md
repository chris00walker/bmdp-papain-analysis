# Ideation Session - Distributor Business

## Ideation Framework

### Phase 2 Insights Driving Design
- **Working Capital Pain**: Customers struggle with 5-10MT minimum orders requiring $150-300K inventory
- **Quality Inconsistency**: 85% of customers experience batch-to-batch quality variation
- **Supply Chain Risk**: Post-pandemic focus on supply chain resilience and diversification
- **Underserved SMEs**: Small-to-medium customers ignored by large global distributors
- **Premium Willingness**: 70%+ customers willing to pay 15-25% premium for value

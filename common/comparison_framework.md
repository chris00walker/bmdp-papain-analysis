## Scoring Methodology

### Individual Business Scoring

Each business receives scores (1-10) across all criteria:

- **1-3**: Poor/High Risk
- **4-6**: Average/Medium Risk  
- **7-8**: Good/Low Risk
- **9-10**: Excellent/Very Low Risk

### Weighted Composite Score

- Financial Metrics: 30%
- Market Metrics: 25%
- Strategic Metrics: 20%
- Operational Metrics: 15%
- Risk Metrics: 10%

### Portfolio Scenarios Evaluation

#### Scenario 1: Single Business Focus

- Select highest-scoring individual business
- Concentrate all resources on one opportunity
- Lower complexity, higher focus

#### Scenario 2: Vertical Integration

- Combine complementary businesses (e.g., grower + processor)
- Evaluate synergies and shared resources
- Higher complexity, potential for higher returns

#### Scenario 3: Portfolio Diversification

- Invest across multiple businesses
- Risk diversification benefits
- Resource allocation optimization

#### Scenario 4: Phased Sequential Entry

- Start with best business, expand based on success
- Lower initial risk, learning-based expansion
- Timeline and milestone-driven approach

## Resource Allocation Model

### Available Resources (To be defined)

- **Total Capital**: $XXX,XXX
- **Human Resources**: X.X FTE
- **Time Horizon**: XX months
- **Risk Tolerance**: Low/Medium/High

### Allocation Constraints

- Minimum viable investment per business
- Resource sharing opportunities
- Timeline dependencies
- Risk concentration limits

## Portfolio Optimization

### Objective Function

Maximize: (Expected Return Ã— Probability of Success) - (Risk-Adjusted Cost of Capital)

Subject to:

- Capital constraints
- Human resource constraints  
- Risk tolerance limits
- Strategic alignment requirements

### Output Recommendations

1. **Recommended Portfolio**: Business combination and resource allocation
2. **Implementation Sequence**: Priority order and timeline
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Portfolio-level risk management
4. **Success Metrics**: KPIs for portfolio performance
5. **Decision Gates**: Go/no-go criteria for each phase

# Template Scope Solutions: 4,383 Variables vs 35 Parser Coverage

## Problem Analysis

**Current State:**

- Parser Variables: 35 (enhanced brief_parser.py)
- Template Variables: 4,383 (across all BMDP phases)
- Coverage: 0.61%

**Root Cause:** Templates represent the complete BMDP methodology (Phases 0-3) with extensive validation cycles, prototyping scenarios, financial modeling, and market research data, while the parser only provides basic business brief extraction.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Adaptive Template Rendering with LLM Integration
**Concept:** Use LLM to intelligently fill template variables based on business context and phase requirements.

**Implementation:**

- Create `tools/processors/adaptive_template_renderer.py`
- Parse templates to identify variable categories (financial, team, risk, etc.)
- Use business brief context + LLM to generate contextually appropriate values
- Implement variable dependency resolution (e.g., budget calculations inform team sizing)
- Cache generated values for consistency across related templates

**Advantages:**

- Maintains template comprehensiveness
- Generates contextually intelligent content
- Scales across all BMDP phases
- Preserves Osterwalder methodology integrity

**Challenges:**

- Requires sophisticated LLM prompting
- Need consistency validation across templates
- Computational overhead for large variable sets

### Solution 2: Hierarchical Template System with Phase-Specific Parsers
**Concept:** Create specialized parsers for each BMDP phase that build upon previous phase outputs.

**Implementation:**

- `tools/parsers/phase0_parser.py` (current brief_parser.py enhanced)
- `tools/parsers/phase1_parser.py` (reads Phase 0 outputs + team composition)
- `tools/parsers/phase2_parser.py` (reads Phase 1 + market research data)
- `tools/parsers/phase3_parser.py` (reads Phase 2 + prototyping results)
- Each parser generates variables for its phase's templates

**Advantages:**

- Modular, maintainable architecture
- Phase-specific expertise
- Builds knowledge progressively
- Clear separation of concerns

**Challenges:**

- Complex inter-phase dependencies
- Requires substantial development effort
- Risk of inconsistencies between phases

### Solution 3: Template Simplification with Core Variable Sets
**Concept:** Reduce template complexity by identifying core variable sets and creating simplified templates.

**Implementation:**

- Analyze 4,383 variables to identify core vs. optional variables
- Create template variants: `basic.j2`, `standard.j2`, `comprehensive.j2`
- Map business complexity to appropriate template level
- Provide upgrade path from basic to comprehensive as data becomes available

**Advantages:**

- Immediate usability with current parser
- Scalable complexity based on business needs
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Clear progression path

**Challenges:**

- May lose BMDP methodology completeness
- Risk of oversimplification
- Need careful variable prioritization

### Solution 4: Dynamic Variable Generation Framework
**Concept:** Create a framework that generates variables on-demand based on template requirements and business context.

**Implementation:**

- `tools/generators/variable_factory.py` with generation strategies
- Business model pattern matching (SaaS, Manufacturing, Marketplace, etc.)
- Industry-specific variable generators
- Fallback to intelligent defaults with "TBD" flagging for human review

**Advantages:**

- Handles any template complexity
- Business model-aware generation
- Extensible for new business types
- Maintains template integrity

**Challenges:**

- Complex generation logic
- Quality control for generated content
- Potential for generic/unrealistic values

### Solution 5: Hybrid Parser-LLM Pipeline
**Concept:** Combine structured parsing with LLM-powered variable expansion.

**Implementation:**

- Enhanced parser provides 100+ core variables (expand current 35)
- LLM processor fills remaining variables using core variables as context
- Template-specific LLM prompts for different variable categories
- Human review checkpoints for critical variables

**Advantages:**

- Leverages both structured data and AI intelligence
- Maintains quality through human oversight
- Scalable to full template complexity
- Preserves methodology rigor

**Challenges:**

- Requires LLM integration infrastructure
- Need quality validation processes
- Potential inconsistencies between AI-generated content

### Solution 6: Template Decomposition with Micro-Services
**Concept:** Break large templates into smaller, focused components with dedicated variable providers.

**Implementation:**

- Decompose templates by functional area (financial, team, risk, market)
- Create specialized micro-parsers for each area
- Compose final documents from rendered components
- Enable independent development and testing of each area

**Advantages:**

- Highly modular and maintainable
- Parallel development possible
- Easier testing and validation
- Clear ownership of functional areas

**Challenges:**

- Complex orchestration requirements
- Integration complexity
- Potential for component inconsistencies

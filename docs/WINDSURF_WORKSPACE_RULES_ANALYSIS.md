# Windsurf Workspace Rules Optimization Analysis

## Current System Architecture Assessment

### üìÅ **Current Structure**

```text
.windsurf/workflows/     # 7 manual workflows
tools/                   # 16 Python validation/execution tools  
templates/               # Jinja2 templates for deliverable generation
```

### üîÑ **Current Workflow Execution Model**

- **Manual Trigger**: Users run `/workflow-name` commands
- **Sequential Execution**: Step-by-step command execution
- **Reactive Validation**: Tools run only when explicitly called
- **Manual Compliance**: Users must remember to validate

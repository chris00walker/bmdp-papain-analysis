# QA Content Validation Workflow
## Based on Osterwalder & Pigneur Methodologies

## Overview

Rigorous quality assurance system implementing validation principles from:

- **Value Proposition Design**: Customer-job fit and value proposition-market fit validation
- **Business Model Generation**: 9 building blocks coherence and viability assessment  
- **Testing Business Ideas**: Evidence-based validation and assumption testing framework

## Layer 1: Value Proposition Design Validation

### Step 1: Customer Jobs Analysis Validation

```bash
# Validate customer jobs identification and prioritization
python tools/vpd_validator.py --business {business_slug} --validate jobs-to-be-done
```

**Osterwalder & Pigneur Quality Criteria:**
- **Functional Jobs**: Clear identification of tasks customers are trying to accomplish

- **Social Jobs**: Recognition of how customers want to be perceived by others
- **Job Importance**: Ranking of jobs by significance to customer
- **Job Satisfaction**: Current satisfaction levels with existing solutions
- **Job Context**: Specific circumstances when jobs arise

### Step 2: Pain Points & Gain Creators Validation
```bash
# Validate pain points identification and gain creators alignment
python tools/vpd_validator.py --business {business_slug} --validate pain-gain-alignment
```

**Osterwalder & Pigneur Quality Criteria:**
- **Pain Severity**: Classification of pains as extreme, moderate, or mild
- **Pain Frequency**: How often customers experience each pain
- **Gain Expectations**: Required, expected, desired, and unexpected gains identification
- **Gain Relevance**: Importance of gains to customer success
- **Evidence-Based**: Pains and gains supported by customer research data

### Step 3: Value Proposition Canvas Coherence
```bash
# Validate value proposition canvas internal coherence
python tools/vpd_validator.py --business {business_slug} --validate canvas-coherence
```

**Osterwalder & Pigneur Quality Criteria:**
- **Pain Relievers Match**: Each significant pain has corresponding pain reliever
- **Gain Creators Alignment**: Gain creators address identified customer gains
- **Product-Service Fit**: Products/services enable pain relievers and gain creators
- **Value Proposition Clarity**: Clear, specific, and measurable value statements
- **Differentiation Evidence**: Unique value compared to alternatives

## Layer 2: Business Model Generation Validation

### Step 4: Nine Building Blocks Coherence Assessment
```bash
# Validate business model canvas building blocks alignment
python tools/bmg_validator.py --business {business_slug} --validate nine-blocks-coherence
```

**Osterwalder & Pigneur Quality Criteria:**
- **Customer Segments-Value Propositions Fit**: Each segment has tailored value proposition
- **Channels Alignment**: Distribution channels match customer preferences and segments
- **Customer Relationships Consistency**: Relationship types support value delivery and revenue model
- **Revenue Streams Logic**: Revenue mechanisms align with value propositions and customer willingness to pay
- **Key Resources-Activities Alignment**: Resources and activities enable value proposition delivery
- **Key Partnerships Strategic Fit**: Partners provide essential resources/activities or reduce risks/costs
- **Cost Structure Optimization**: Cost drivers align with key activities and resources
- **Internal Coherence**: All building blocks reinforce each other synergistically

### Step 5: Business Model Viability Assessment
```bash
# Assess overall business model viability using BMG principles
python tools/bmg_validator.py --business {business_slug} --validate viability-assessment
```

**Osterwalder & Pigneur Quality Criteria:**

## Layer 3: Testing Business Ideas Validation

### Step 6: Assumption Identification & Testing Framework
```bash
# Validate assumption testing methodology and evidence quality
python tools/tbi_validator.py --business {business_slug} --validate assumption-testing
```

**Osterwalder & Pigneur Quality Criteria:**
- **Assumption Mapping**: Critical assumptions identified across all business model components
- **Risk Assessment**: Assumptions ranked by importance and evidence strength
- **Test Design**: Appropriate test methods selected for each assumption type
- **Evidence Quality**: Tests provide reliable, unbiased data about assumptions
- **Learning Integration**: Test results inform business model iterations
- **Pivot Indicators**: Clear criteria for when to pivot or persevere

### Step 7: Evidence-Based Decision Making Validation
```bash
# Validate quality and sufficiency of evidence supporting business decisions
python tools/tbi_validator.py --business {business_slug} --validate evidence-quality
```

**Osterwalder & Pigneur Quality Criteria:**
- **Evidence Triangulation**: Multiple sources and methods validate key assumptions
- **Sample Representativeness**: Test participants represent target customer segments
- **Bias Minimization**: Tests designed to avoid confirmation bias and leading questions
- **Statistical Significance**: Quantitative tests have adequate sample sizes and confidence levels
- **Qualitative Depth**: Customer interviews reveal deep insights about jobs, pains, and gains
- **Evidence Documentation**: Clear audit trail of all tests, results, and interpretations

## Layer 4: Osterwalder & Pigneur Quality Assessment

### Step 8: Methodology Compliance Scoring
```bash
# Calculate methodology-specific quality scores
python tools/osterwalder_pigneur_scorer.py --business {business_slug} --comprehensive-assessment
```

**Osterwalder & Pigneur Quality Dimensions:**
- **Value Proposition Design Compliance**: 35% weight
  - Customer jobs completeness and depth
  - Pain-gain identification accuracy
  - Value proposition-customer fit evidence

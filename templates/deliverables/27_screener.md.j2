## Quality Assurance

- **Respect time**: Keep screening brief and focused
- **Document thoroughly**: Capture key insights for interview preparation

### Common Screening Mistakes
- **Leading questions**: "You probably struggle with X, right?"
- **Overselling**: Making the study sound more interesting than it is
- **Rushing**: Not allowing time for thoughtful responses
- **Bias**: Screening in participants who don't truly qualify
- **Poor documentation**: Missing key details for interview planning

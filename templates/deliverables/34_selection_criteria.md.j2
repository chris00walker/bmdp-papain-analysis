## Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Individual Scoring
Each core team member independently scores each business model alternative against all criteria using the 1-10 scale.

**Scoring Team**:
- {{ team_lead | default("Team Lead") }}: Overall business perspective
- {{ business_expert | default("Business Expert") }}: Market and business model expertise
- {{ market_analyst | default("Market Analyst") }}: Market and competitive analysis
- {{ financial_analyst | default("Financial Analyst") }}: Financial viability assessment
- {{ technical_lead | default("Technical Lead") }}: Technology and execution feasibility

### Step 2: Score Normalization
Individual scores are averaged across team members for each criterion to create normalized scores.

### Step 3: Weighted Calculation
Normalized scores are multiplied by criterion weights to calculate weighted scores for each business model.

### Step 4: Sensitivity Analysis
Test different weighting scenarios to understand robustness of rankings:
- **Conservative Scenario**: Higher weight on execution feasibility and financial viability
- **Aggressive Scenario**: Higher weight on market attractiveness and competitive advantage
- **Balanced Scenario**: Equal weighting across all major criteria
